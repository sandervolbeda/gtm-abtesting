# Page Path
A page path, often referred to as a URL path or simply a path, is a specific segment of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that identifies the location or address of a particular web page or resource on the internet. It comes after the domain name (or host) in a URL and provides information about the hierarchy or structure of the website's content.

In a typical URL format like ```https://sandervolbeda.com/page/subpage```, the page path is the portion after the domain (sandervolbeda.com). In this example, the page path is /page/subpage. Each segment of the path, separated by slashes (/), represents a specific directory or subdirectory within the website's structure.
